# qt_slideshow

This is a very simple python program that uses QT to display images on a screen. It was mostly written by ChatGPT4 as I've never used QT before.

This version uses pyside6 but it appears to work just fine with pyside2 or PyQt* (though I did see a crash using PyQt6 when running images as fast as possible). 

It uses two timers. One to show an image and the other to show the word "Paused" when paused.

See keypress for support keyboard commands.
